## Surface

### Design
  * Colour Scheme	
    I chose green/blue as the main site color palette as I though it matched well with the domain material and hero image.
  * Typography
    Poppins as the main font and Dancing for a little flair. Both from Google Fonts 
   * Imagery
    Hero image of kitchen table with empty notebook helps convey the sites main goal.
    Food and cookery themed icons and images throughout the website help bring the application to life.
