## Testing

### W3C Validators
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. Please note, that the edit_recipe page has a small number of errors which I believe are due to 1. materialize css and 2. the dynamic creation of controls are runtime. I will come back to fix these.Data Centric Development

### Testing planning.
With this project I have use Test [Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) model (TDD).

The TDD method consists of a cycle of :
* write new test
* implement new feature
* run all tests & repeat all steps until all tests pass.

    * Recipes are searchable by name and description.
4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to view my favourite recipes.
    * Users can pin recipes to their profile for easy retrival later.

#### Frequent User Goals
